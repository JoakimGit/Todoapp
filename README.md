This is a solution to the [Todo app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW). 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

### What I learned

Going with a mobile first approach and making the application responsive was a first for me. It took longer than expected despite the small size of the project, but focusing on the CSS and making it work across different viewports was a good learning experience that I will employ more of in the future.
